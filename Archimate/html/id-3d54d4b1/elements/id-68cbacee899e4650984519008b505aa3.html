Additional information: The concept of Managing Self-description Schemas in the Federated Catalogue involves the creation and management of metadata that describes the data and services available in a federated environment. This metadata is used to enable discovery, understanding, and use of the data and services by users and applications. The self-description schemas provide a standardized way of describing the data and services, which makes it easier for users to find and use them. The federated catalogue is a central repository that stores the metadata and provides a search interface for users to discover the data and services. Effective management of self-description schemas in the federated catalogue is essential for ensuring that the data and services are discoverable, understandable, and usable by users and applications.

Example: Decision: Self-Descriptions refer to one or several schemas via a "isA" relation.
Every schema consists of classes and classes define attributes and relations to other Self-Descriptions.
Only attributes from a class can be used for the Self-Descriptions.
The Self-Description classes form an extensible inheritance hierarchy.
For example geo-location for some Nodes.
The Self-Description classes are versioned according to the Semantic Versioning conventions.
GAIA-X provides and maintains a set of core Self-Description classes.
The schema hierarchy can be extended with specialized classes, for example for a domain-specific ecosystem.
GAIA-X defines requirements and processes to accept and distribute new Self-Description classes and updates thereof.
- Option 1: Central repo by the GAIA-X Foundation for schemas
- Option 2: Ecosystems / private catalogues can have additional schema sources
RDF and SHACL are selected as technologies for schema description and enforcement.
- RDF: Data model "behind" JSON-LD
- SHACL: Validation of RDF against a schema independently from the serialization technology
Rationale: For the purpose of validating Self-Descriptions, the Federated Catalogue needs to know the Schema to validate against.
Gaia-X develops an extensible hierarchy of Schemas that define the terms used in Self-Descriptions.
Some Schemas are standardized by the Gaia-X AISBL and must be supported by any Catalogue, but it should be possible to create additional ones specific to an application domain, an Ecosystem, Participants in it, or Assets offered by these Participants.
Schemas have the same format as Self-Descriptions, i.e., they are graphs in the RDF data model, serialized as JSON-LD.
A Schema may define terms (classes, their attributes, and their relationships to other classes) in an Ontology.
If it does, it must also define Shapes to validate instances of the Ontology against.
A Schema may also introduce a Controlled Vocabulary of attribute values intended to be reused.

dct:title: Architecture Decision Record about Managing Self-Description Schemas in the Federated Catalogue

eira:adr_context: The context explains why we need to make a decision. It also describes the alternatives along with the pros and cons.

eira:adr_decision: The decision describes the justification for why the particular solution was accepted. It has more emphasis on the why rather than the how.

eira:adr_status: [Proposed (under review)|Accepted (approved and ready for implementation)|Superseded (superseded by another decision)]

eira:adr_consecuences: The consequences section contains information about the overall impact of an architectural decision. Every decision has trade-offs. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s crucial to include the analysis to provide a clear picture.
