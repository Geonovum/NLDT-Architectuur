LOST view: Technical view - application

EIRA concept: eira:ArchitectureBuildingBlock

ABB name: eira:E-ArchivingApplicationComponent

Synonym: Preservation Service

Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): CEF eArchiving - eArchiving provides the core specifications, software, training and knowledge to tackle the challenge of short, medium and long-term data management and reuse in a sustainable, authentic, cost-efficient, manageable and interoperable way.(https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eArchiving)

Interoperability Saliency: The e-Archiving Component ABB &#160;is salient for technical interoperability because it provides the implementation of the functionalities for the long-term or permanent preservation of records and information in electronic form in order to ensure their temporal egibility, reliability and integrity as stated in the EIF: "Legislation requires that decisions and data are stored and can be accessed for a specified time. This means that records and information in electronic form held by public administrations for the purpose of documenting procedures and decisions must be preserved and be converted, where necessary, to new media when old media become obsolete. The goal is to ensure that records and other forms of information keep their legibility, reliability and integrity and can be accessed as long as needed subject to security and privacy provisions."

Additional information: The EIRA&#169; differentiates between document management, record management and e-archiving as follows: &#8226;	Document management is primarily about day-to-day use of electronic documents (create/update/delete/versioning) within the operational environment; &#8226;	Record management is primarily about ensuring that information (e.g. in form of an electronic document or database record) is available for business and legal purposes (e.g. to proof and track the handling of contracts). If an electronic document or information is becoming a record (an authority declares it as a record) that electronic document or information needs to be handled by the record management service (based on specific business or legal reasons (e.g. contract negotiation)); &#8226;	e-Archiving is primarily about storing records which have been selected (by an authority) for permanent or long-term preservation due to their enduring research value and as a memory aid. An electronic document or information which a) is managed by the document management service or the record management service and b) is no longer needed for business or legal purposes or day-to-day activities, and c) still has value for research purposes or as a memory aid, the electronic document should be managed by the e-archiving service&#8221;.
