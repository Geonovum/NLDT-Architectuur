This means that the system should be able to handle increased traffic or workload without compromising its performance or stability. Elasticity is important for systems that experience unpredictable or fluctuating demand, as it allows them to maintain optimal performance and avoid downtime. It also helps organizations to optimize their resource utilization and reduce costs by scaling down when demand decreases.

Additional information: According to the TOGAF specification, Elasticity is a non-functional requirement that refers to the ability of a system to scale up or down its resources in response to changing demands. This requirement is closely related to the concept of scalability, which refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing workloads without compromising its performance.

Elasticity is an important requirement for systems that are expected to handle varying levels of traffic or workload. For example, a web application that experiences a sudden surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign or a news event should be able to scale up its resources to handle the increased demand. Similarly, a system that experiences a decrease in traffic during off-peak hours should be able to scale down its resources to save costs.

To achieve elasticity, a system should be designed with the following characteristics:

1. Modularity: The system should be composed of independent modules that can be scaled up or down independently.

2. Automation: The scaling process should be automated to minimize human intervention and reduce the risk of errors.

3. Monitoring: The system should be monitored continuously to detect changes in demand and trigger the scaling process.

4. Resilience: The system should be able to handle failures and recover quickly from them.

5. Flexibility: The system should be able to adapt to different types of workloads and resource requirements.

Overall, elasticity is an important non-functional requirement that can help ensure that a system is able to handle changing demands and provide a consistent level of performance.

Example: An example of the IT non-functional requirement 'Elasticity' could be the ability of a cloud-based application to automatically scale up or down its computing resources based on the current demand. This means that the application should be able to handle sudden spikes in traffic without crashing or slowing down, while also being able to reduce its resource usage during periods of low activity to save costs.
