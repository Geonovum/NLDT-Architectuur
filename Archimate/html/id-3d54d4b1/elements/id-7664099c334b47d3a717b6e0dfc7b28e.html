Title: Neo-Weberian-State approach (NWS)

Additional information: NWS is a hierarchy-driven system within a hierarchy-market-network space. This NWS (based and driven by hierarchy) then moved to one of the normative reform models. 

The Neo-Weberian-State approach is focused an aimed to ensure three main core principles, that are specifically relevant to the development of eGovernment and societies:  inclusive and equitable service delivery, resilient crises governance, and effective innovation for government and society. 

The application of the principle or the work towards the approach is a key enabler for digital and healthy societies, where users and the overall society is taken into account, and put on the focus on the development of Digital Public Services. 
The UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose is focused on the development and research of how digital platforms and services can improve societies.
