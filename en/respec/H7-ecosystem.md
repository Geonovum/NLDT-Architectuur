# nLDT and other initiatives

The nLDT reference architecture describes principles and patterns for the network of Local Digital Twins. There are many initiatives at regional, national, and European scales that try to do something similar. We do not see this reference architecture as the only truth, but we do try to offer a comprehensible structure and order that can stimulate convergence in initiatives.

## ZoN Datafundament

The target architecture for ZoN Datafundament is in progress (status Q2 2025). The target architecture ZoN Datafundament describes a Dataspace for the physical environment within the Netherlands. The nLDT reference architecture can primarily be seen as a consumer (and to a lesser extent, provider) of products and services described in the Target Architecture of ZoN Datafundament.
Thus, there is a large overlap between these architectures which will be carefully aligned during development.

## Gebora

GEBORA is a Built Environment Reference Architecture. GEBORA provides a coherent overview of how people, processes, and technology in the Built Environment collaborate digitally. This is based on best practices and standards from that sector [[Gebora]]. The built environment and physical environment have many commonalities, but there is often also a distinction in scope, processes, and involved organizational units.
- GEBORA primarily describes the life cycle of a construction work and the chain processes and the roles of companies and organizations therein.
- The nLDT generally describes societal challenges from a broader scope and focuses on area development. Predictive computational models make it possible to forecast the consequences of interventions. This provides insights that contribute to decision-making. 

Among other things, in the area of integrating BIM models into the environment, there is a clear overlap. This is addressed by DigiGO via Policy Measure 7: Digitally connecting BIM models for infrastructure and geo-data.

## FDS

The Federated Data System (FDS) in the Netherlands focuses on public data exchange at the national level, embedded in European frameworks. FDS is developing into a set of agreements that makes the data potential of various sector-, domain-, or theme-oriented data systems available in accordance with public values for public purposes [[FDS]]. Thus, FDS provides a basic system upon which both ZoN Datafundament and nLDT are built.

## EU Dataspaces

There are several EU Dataspace initiatives underway, like the Green Deal Dataspace, the Mobility Dataspace and the Health Dataspace.
The exact interoperability arrangments between the various initiatives are unclear at the time of writing of this document. However, we feel that the Architectural Principles, Capabilities and Patterns described in the reference architecture are in line with the various Dataspace initiatives and solutions that are developed according to the nLDT architecture will be aligned to the patterns emerging in the Dataspaces.

## LDT

This nLDT architecture is in line with earlier work done in [[LDT]] and [[DUET]] and builds on top of the patterns described in those publications.
