We endorse the core values and digital rights and principles of the EU Digital Decade and specifically focus on core values and goals from the NLDT perspective.

## Purpose

### Purpose-driven, for common good

Digital twins and the digital twin system should improve objects, processes, and systems in the physical environment. Digital twins are never a goal; they are means to achieve a goal. Responsible digital twins serve the common good and create value for society. They operate from a clear, singular, and above all justified purpose. 

__Explanation:__ A justified purpose is the necessary first step to properly adhere to all other principles. The purpose determines who should be involved in the development of the digital twin; what data are minimally necessary; how inclusive, complete, and accurate the data must be, etc.. Digital twins can provide insights to businesses, governments, education and research, civil society organizations, and citizens for better planning, development, and use of the physical environment, and also improve the management and maintenance of existing objects, processes, and systems.

__Elaboration:__ Establishing a justified purpose primarily requires understanding. Understand and internalize the origin, context, dynamics, and perspective of the purpose, the question, the problem. Together with end-users and other primary stakeholders explore whether the digital twin is the best way to achieve the goal. Are there other ways, alternative solution directions (investigated) by which the question can be answered? What need does the digital twin and the digital twin system serve, and does the digital twin meet that need? Digital twins and the system of digital twins must be structured and shared to promote cooperation and innovation in the economy and society, in accordance with the principle of common good. The needs and wishes of the users of digital twins are central to this. Common good does not mean that digital twins are only financed with public funds from the government, but also requires investments from the business community for economic ‘value creation’. Digital twins and the system of digital twins stimulate cooperation and innovation throughout the economy and society for the benefit of the common good.

## Trust

### Actively open and transparent

Digital twins and a system of digital twins should be as openly available as possible. That is to say that they contain open or shared data, which are accessible via open standards to ensure that they create the most value for society. Transparency is intended to provide insight, clarification, and explanation. Insight into the context and implementation of the digital twin and the system, explanation of the choices made in the process, clarification about the data, the models, visualization (tools) and during decision-making.

We state: “as open as possible” because it may be important that participants in the system also share information that is not suitable for broad, open, dissemination. Think about privacy and security restrictions. The system should also enable confidential, protected information sharing. 

__Explanation:__ A system of digital twins will benefit from network effects: the more people or organizations use, contribute to, and maintain the system, the more valuable and useful it becomes.

__Elaboration:__ Openness is an important element for realizing digital twins and an ecosystem of digital twins maximizing value for the economy and society. An open, cooperative approach will be necessary to ensure that the ecosystem remains current and relevant for a broad range of users, thereby reducing the chance of silos and inefficiency. Openness also requires digital twins to be findable and accessible, so that users can find and use relevant data, computational models, and visualization tools. Openness is about making data, models, visualization tools, and technologies accessible, reusable, and exchangeable. It is not only about technical accessibility, but also accessibility for the stakeholders: the users, citizens, and other primary stakeholders. Explain and provide access to the information that stakeholders need to participate and contribute. A digital twin system must reflect the right balance between openness and (role-based) access restrictions, that is based on agreed management mechanisms.

### Fair, qualitative, and inclusive

The reliability of digital twins or a system of digital twins is dependent on the quality and inclusivity of the data, models, and technology. The primary stakeholders must be able to assess this reliability on aspects such as the relevance, timeliness, accuracy, coherence and consistency, interpretability, and accessibility of the digital twins, in relation to the intended use. Quality standards and quality levels for data and models must be defined and agreed upon to be able to use data and models in digital twins. It is important that the digital twin and the system are sufficiently inclusive and integral, not only concerning the technology, but also the underlying data and the stakeholders involved. Bias, assumptions, consciously or unconsciously favoring or disadvantaging, unintended discrimination, and profiling of individuals, groups of people, and locations is an ever-present risk when using digital twins. The social and economic value through digital twins must accrue to all stakeholders.

__Explanation:__ Providing the right, relevant metadata supports the responsible use of data and computational models in digital twins, thereby enabling effective data integration to create value. Providers of data and computational models to a digital twin system should assess the quality of data and computational models based on the functionality, lifespan, and security, that are necessary to achieve the purpose for which the data and computational models are (or will be) used. A digital twin can never be an exact copy of reality. Precisely for that reason it is important to indicate where the limits lie and in which aspects a realistic picture is indeed sketched. A picture that is free from bias. It is important to include that even individuals not represented in the digital twin, can be affected by assumptions of the digital twin or its user.

__Elaboration:__ The system of digital twins must apply minimum quality standards for data and computational models. This is especially important for cases where the correct quality standard is difficult to determine. Quality levels must be transparent, defined, measurable, and managed within the system of digital twins. During the collection, analysis, interpretation, visualization, and automated decisions of and with data, attention must be paid to and assessed for bias to prevent any unintended effects, including the occurrence of unintended discrimination. This bias applies not only to the stakeholders involved, who develop and use the digital twin, but also to the technology itself. Technology is never neutral. Periodic checks for bias in digital twins are necessary to ensure that the digital twins are fair and non-discriminatory.

### Robust and secure

A digital twin and the system of digital twins must be robust and secure. That means that data and computational models and the technical infrastructure on which digital twins run have high availability and are well protected (possibly with access restrictions) against undesired use. A digital twin may only expose sensitive information (i.e. personal data) if explicit consent has been obtained from the involved parties and the exposure is also legally permitted. A digital twin must be reviewed by independent parties, to be able to continuously guarantee security and data protection.

__Explanation:__ Data security and cyber security are essential to ensure the integrity of digital twins and the digital twin system. A robust and secure approach will instill confidence in the integrity and use of digital twins and the system. This principle should be balanced with the other principles such as openness and transparency. In addition, a digital twin is also legally obligated to respect the privacy of individuals. Digital twins are a good way to study the spatial behavior of a synthetic population in the physical environment without thereby infringing on the privacy of individuals. Thereby, the developers and users of the digital twin must reflect on what ‘personal data’ are. The combination of different insensitive datasets can lead to sensitive information about individuals being revealed.

__Elaboration:__ Security in digital twins can be technically implemented in multiple ways and is a balancing act between ease of use and provided assurances. Measures are possible in the infrastructure of the data exchange, the systems used, process agreements around digital twins and in the used data and computational models. 
Frameworks like 'Network and Information Security Directive 2' (NIS2) or the EU Cybersecurity Act can help provide guidance and legitimize efforts in the implementation of measures for security and reliability.
Apply certification where possible. In addition, stakeholders involved in developing and using digital twins must explicitly and very consciously give permission for the (temporary) collection, linking, use, and sharing of their data. It is also important that it is made very clear for what specific purpose they are making their data available. Why and how exactly this data and its application contribute to the underlying question. Also explore ‘no go areas’ for the digital twin, to protect vulnerable locations and communities.

## People

### People at the centre, human in the loop

An independent trusted third party must supervise compliance with ethical and other relevant agreements, so that the digital twin, the system of digital twins, and the underlying data are handled responsibly. The digital twins and the system must be under human control and supervision. Supervision and control must take place during the development process and the usage phase of the digital twin.

__Explanation:__ The responsibility for ethics should not rest with one person, staff department, or committee. That removes responsibility from others and for internal processes. It is desirable that an independent party supervises different components of the digital twin and the system. For example, when assessing suppliers and their data products. The ethical codes are a guide, but must be internalized by the team each time anew and throughout the entire process.

__Elaboration:__ Control and supervision must come from the people: the team. Address each other on moral responsibility and adherence to ethical values and agreements. Ask external parties for an explanation of how they will meet ethical agreements. An organization can also account for the use of data and adherence to ethical standards in its annual report.

### Stakeholders actively involved

For societal challenges, solidary involvement of primary stakeholders is a prerequisite for achieving open, fair, and inclusive judgment, and decision-making. This is a prerequisite for achieving an open, fair, and inclusive system of digital twins. Even for commercial applications that do not serve a societal purpose, the involvement of primary stakeholders is essential. A sustainable trust relationship promotes the quality, the demand for, and the adoption of (data and information) products. By far the most important stakeholders are the people who share their personal data and everyone else who is affected by the application of the data and the digital twin. It is important to involve citizens and other primary stakeholders as early as the design phase of the digital twin. This is to stimulate ‘co-ownership’ and to facilitate gathering insights from relevant stakeholders. Give significant weight to the contributions of primary stakeholders.

__Explanation:__ The nature and extent of involvement of primary stakeholders differs per challenge, per issue, per assignment, per product, per situation. This is influenced by: the impact on people; the duration (one-off, temporary or structural); the risks (privacy, security, equality); the geographical scope (international, national, regional, (hyper)local); the domain (public, private); the specific purpose of the data use; the phase of development and realization. This also determines the (working) form through which primary stakeholders are involved. That is custom work. Often, the community is only involved in a project in the testing phase, when the digital twin is ready for use. Feedback is then encouraged and taken into account, but this limits the most important stakeholders to a reaction to what already exists. That does not represent intensive, solidary involvement. The quality of ethics depends on the quality of the conversation with the right people, on asking and deepening the right questions at the right time.

__Elaboration:__ Ask the question: Who are the primary stakeholders? Who is the community? Which are the involved parties? There are different types of parties that can be involved in different ways. Collaborate with and learn from (societal) parties that pursue the same goal. The government is an important stakeholder and channel for societal challenges through which citizens can be reached and involved.

## Effective

### Effectively governed

All components of a digital twin and the system of digital twins have clear and transparent ownership, clear governance, assigned responsibilities, and possibly established regulations to support the creation, maintenance, and responsible use of relevant data, computational models, and visualization (tools).

__Explanation:__ Clear ownership and assigned responsibilities enable effective data management and problem-solving for a single digital twin and within the system as a whole. The government could use regulations to stimulate desired behavior in an ecosystem when this is not possible through cooperation between business, government, education and research, civil society organizations, and citizens. 

__Elaboration:__ Data ownership is a central element of this principle and provides accountability for compiling suitable quality data for integration into digital twins and the digital twin ecosystem. Data owners and providers must collaborate with stakeholders to identify high-quality datasets for digital twins. Data owners and providers must also possess the appropriate skills and competencies, that are necessary to enable digital twins. Digital twins can be governed by business, government, education and research, civil society organizations and/or citizens. Governance must also provide mechanisms for the overall management of the digital twin ecosystem, thereby ensuring fair value and consistent adherence to standards.

### Federated

Owners of (components of) digital twins must support a federated model where data, models, tools, and related, supporting services can be connected and shared in a flexible and responsive manner. 

__Explanation:__ With a federated model, business and all levels of government (national, regional, and local) will retain authority for their respective responsibilities, their functions, and associated data, that are part of the networked local digital twin infrastructure.

__Elaboration:__ The federated model requires and encourages business and government to develop and manage the components of the digital twin in consistent, interoperable, cross-platform, and platform-independent ways. With the federated model, scaling is stimulated and users across the entire economy and society can use digital twins within and between application areas, sectors, and jurisdictions. Governance is an essential part of this principle. The proposed federated model requires a level of consistent governance over different sectors, but also between business and government. Governance of the federated model must specifically ensure, that digital twins for the physical  environment can work with different types of data (sources) within and between:

- different infrastructure and application sectors (e.g., mobility, agriculture, energy, climate);
- both the built and natural environment;
- different spatial and temporal scales;
- different modeling approaches.

### Using open standards

This architecture adopts agreed-upon open standards for data and digital twins, with cross-platform and platform-independent architectural models to provide overall interoperability, compatibility, and functionality. 

__Explanation:__ Open standards for data and digital twins ensure trust through open and uniform semantics and exchange, prevent vendor lock-in, are cost reducing and ensure that digital twins and the digital twin ecosystem deliver optimal value.

__Elaboration:__ Use of open standards ensures that digital twins and the digital twin ecosystem are vendor-independent. The use of open standards, such as semantic data models and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), ensures broad accessibility and uniform use of data and digital twins in economy and society. 


### Adaptive

Digital twins for the physical environment must be able to continuously adapt and develop as the physical environment changes and the world around us evolves as a result of changes in society, technology, functional requirements, information management, data science, cybersecurity. 

__Explanation:__ Continuous adaptation of digital twins ensures, that digital twins remain usable and evolve to meet the changing needs of end-users and  data-based planning and decision-making remains possible for both business, government, education and knowledge institutions, civil society organizations and citizens.

__Elaboration:__ Digital twins will continue to adapt and evolve. Technical solutions for digital twins, especially platforms and software, are impartial to enable the continuous adaptation and evolution of digital twins and the ecosystem of digital twins in the long term.
